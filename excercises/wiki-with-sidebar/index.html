                    <b><i>Final Fantasy XIV</i></b><sup>[c]</sup> 
                    is a massively multiplayer 
                    online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed 
                    and published by Square Enix. Directed and 
                    produced by Naoki Yoshida and released 
                    worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Windows 
                    in August 2013, it replaced the failed 
                    2010 version, with subsequent support for 
                    PlayStation 4, macOS, PlayStation 5, and 
                    Xbox Series X/S. <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> is set 
                    in the fantasy region of Eorzea, five years 
                    after the devastating Seventh Umbral Calamity 
                    which ended the original version. In the 
                    Calamity, the elder primal Bahamut escaped 
                    from his prison, an ancient space station 
                    called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse 
                    across Eorzea. Through temporal magic, 
                    the player character of the original 
                    version escaped, reappearing at the 
                    start of <i>A Realm Reborn</i>. As Eorzea 
                    cements its recovery, the player must 
                    fend off a reignited invasion from 
                    the Garlean Empire.

                    The original <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i>
                    was a commercial and critical failure. 
                    Then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada 
                    announced that a new team, led by 
                    Yoshida, would assume control and 
                    address the game’s flaws. The new team 
                    both continued to develop and improve 
                    the original version, and secretly worked 
                    on a completely new replacement. 
                    This new game, codenamed “Version 2.0”, 
                    used a new engine, improved server 
                    infrastructure, and revamped gameplay, 
                    interface, and story. The original 
                    version shut down in November 2012, 
                    followed by an alpha test for Version 2.0.

                    The relaunched game released to largely 
                    positive reception; critics praised its 
                    solid mechanics and progression, and 
                    commended Yoshida for an unexpected recovery. 
                    After a poor 2013 fiscal year, Square Enix 
                    attributed the 2014 return to profitability 
                    partly to the game’s strong sales and 
                    subscriber base. By October 2021, it had 
                    gained over 24 million registered players, 
                    and become the most profitable <i>Final Fantasy</i>
                    game to date.<sup>[1]</sup> 
                    <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> has received 
                    regular updates since release, including five major 
                    expansion packs: <i>Heavensward</i> (2015), 
                    <i>Stormblood</i> 
                    (2017), <i>Shadowbringers</i> (2019), 
                    <i>Endwalker</i> (2021), and <i>Dawntrail</i> (2024).

                    <b><i>Final Fantasy XIV</i></b> is an MMORPG, 
                    featuring a persistent world where 
                    players can interact with each other 
                    and the environment. Players create and 
                    customize their characters for use in 
                    the game, including name, race, gender, 
                    facial features, and starting class. 
                    Unlike in the original release, players 
                    may only choose to be a Disciple of War 
                    or Magic as a starting class—Disciples 
                    of the Hand and Land are initially 
                    unavailable.<sup>[2]</sup> Players must also select 
                    a game server for each character. 
                    While all supported languages are 
                    available on every server, data 
                    centers are located in specific 
                    regions (i.e., North America, Europe, 
                    Japan, and Oceania) to reduce latency 
                    between client and server, and players 
                    are advised to choose a server in their 
                    region.<sup>[3]</sup> Regardless of server or 
                    language, players can use a large 
                    library of automatically translated 
                    game terms and general phrases, 
                    allowing players who speak different 
                    languages to communicate.<sup>[4]</sup>
