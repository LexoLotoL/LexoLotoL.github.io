                    <b><i>Final Fantasy XIV</i></b><sup>[c]</sup> 
                    is a massively multiplayer 
                    online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed 
                    and published by Square Enix. Directed and 
                    produced by Naoki Yoshida and released 
                    worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Windows 
                    in August 2013, it replaced the failed 
                    2010 version, with subsequent support for 
                    PlayStation 4, macOS, PlayStation 5, and 
                    Xbox Series X/S. <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> is set 
                    in the fantasy region of Eorzea, five years 
                    after the devastating Seventh Umbral Calamity 
                    which ended the original version. In the 
                    Calamity, the elder primal Bahamut escaped 
                    from his prison, an ancient space station 
                    called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse 
                    across Eorzea. Through temporal magic, 
                    the player character of the original 
                    version escaped, reappearing at the 
                    start of <i>A Realm Reborn</i>. As Eorzea 
                    cements its recovery, the player must 
                    fend off a reignited invasion from 
                    the Garlean Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i>
                    was a commercial and critical failure. 
                    Then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada 
                    announced that a new team, led by 
                    Yoshida, would assume control and 
                    address the game’s flaws. The new team 
                    both continued to develop and improve 
                    the original version, and secretly worked 
                    on a completely new replacement. 
                    This new game, codenamed “Version 2.0”, 
                    used a new engine, improved server 
                    infrastructure, and revamped gameplay, 
                    interface, and story. The original 
                    version shut down in November 2012, 
                    followed by an alpha test for Version 2.0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relaunched game released to largely 
                    positive reception; critics praised its 
                    solid mechanics and progression, and 
                    commended Yoshida for an unexpected recovery. 
                    After a poor 2013 fiscal year, Square Enix 
                    attributed the 2014 return to profitability 
                    partly to the game’s strong sales and 
                    subscriber base. By October 2021, it had 
                    gained over 24 million registered players, 
                    and become the most profitable <i>Final Fantasy</i>
                    game to date.<sup>[1]</sup> 
                    <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> has received 
                    regular updates since release, including five major 
                    expansion packs: <i>Heavensward</i> (2015), 
                    <i>Stormblood</i> 
                    (2017), <i>Shadowbringers</i> (2019), 
                    <i>Endwalker</i> (2021), and <i>Dawntrail</i> (2024).
                </p>
                <h2 id="section-2">Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    <b><i>Final Fantasy XIV</i></b> is an MMORPG, 
                    featuring a persistent world where 
                    players can interact with each other 
                    and the environment. Players create and 
                    customize their characters for use in 
                    the game, including name, race, gender, 
                    facial features, and starting class. 
                    Unlike in the original release, players 
                    may only choose to be a Disciple of War 
                    or Magic as a starting class—Disciples 
                    of the Hand and Land are initially 
                    unavailable.<sup>[2]</sup> Players must also select 
                    a game server for each character. 
                    While all supported languages are 
                    available on every server, data 
                    centers are located in specific 
                    regions (i.e., North America, Europe, 
                    Japan, and Oceania) to reduce latency 
                    between client and server, and players 
                    are advised to choose a server in their 
                    region.<sup>[3]</sup> Regardless of server or 
                    language, players can use a large 
                    library of automatically translated 
                    game terms and general phrases, 
                    allowing players who speak different 
                    languages to communicate.<sup>[4]</sup>
                </p>
                <h2 id="section-3">Interface</h2>
                <p>
                    PC and home console versions use a unified 
                    user interface (UI) and control scheme allowing 
                    for any combination of keyboard, mouse, and game 
                    controller. On PC, the game defaults to drag and 
                    drop menus, whereas on the console versions, the 
                    default interface resembles the PlayStation 
                    3's XrossMediaBar.[5] This bar is used to 
                    access menus, maps, logs, and configuration 
                    options. The head-up display for both versions 
                    includes a message log, party status menu, 
                    mini-map, and action bar. The size and 
                    location of all UI elements may be customized.[6]
                    Actions and battle commands differ between 
                    PC and console versions. The PC versions 
                    support both point and click and keyboard 
                    input for commands or macros. Macro commands 
                    are customizable sequences of actions that 
                    allow players to execute desired abilities 
                    at a specific time. The home console versions 
                    instead map the action bar and macros to the 
                    "Cross Hotbar"—sets of four icons arranged in 
                    a cross shape. These are the grouped and 
                    accessed through a combination of the shoulder 
                    buttons and the directional pad or the face 
                    buttons. Using each shoulder button to cycle 
                    through the cross sets, players have quick 
                    access to commands. This interface is also 
                    available to PC players who use controllers.[5]
                </p>
                <h2 id="section-4">Character Progression</h2>
                <p>
                    Players improve their characters by 
                    gaining experience points (EXP) and 
                    acquiring stronger equipment. After 
                    gaining enough XP, the character will 
                    "level up", improving their statistics, 
                    enhancing the character's performance, 
                    and often learning new actions. Primary 
                    sources of experience points in Final 
                    Fantasy XIV include completing quests, 
                    exploring instanced dungeons, 
                    participating in Full Active Time Events 
                    (FATEs), and slaying monsters in 
                    the world.[7] Quests, including the 
                    "main scenario" questline, are 
                    generally short, specific tasks 
                    given to the player by non-player 
                    characters which reward items and EXP. 
                    Completing main scenario quests progresses 
                    the overarching plot of the game. Some 
                    quests are repeatable, either "daily" 
                    quests repeatable each day, or "Levequests", 
                    which consume "leve allowances" that the 
                    player slowly accrues over time. Dungeons 
                    often require multiple players to form 
                    a party to enter, but the Duty Support 
                    system enables the player to play 
                    certain dungeons alone, supported 
                    by computer-controlled party members. 
                    Some dungeons are for lower-leveled 
                    players to gain EXP quickly while 
                    others are for experienced players 
                    to collect rare items, equipment, 
                    and currency.[8] The Duty Roulette 
                    system randomly assigns the player 
                    to an accessible dungeon, and once 
                    per day, awards additional bonus 
                    EXP scaled to character level on 
                    completion.[9] FATEs permit large 
                    groups of players, whether or not 
                    they are in a party, to participate 
                    in a shared task in the world. These 
                    location-specific events include battles 
                    with notorious monsters, defending locations, 
                    escorting non-player characters, culling wildlife, 
                    and assaulting enemy fortresses, among other types.
                    [8] Finally, each enemy the player kills provides 
                    EXP, with further EXP available from the Hunting Log, 
                    for killing a fixed amount of specific creatures. 
                    At maximum level, character progression focuses 
                    entirely on acquiring stronger equipment, 
                    raising the character's "item level". 
                    This equipment can be gained through a 
                    variety of sources including endgame dungeons, 
                    crafting, raids, primal battles, and elite 
                    mark hunts.[10]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these player versus environment
                    (PvE) challenges, various forms of player 
                    versus player (PvP) combat exist in Final
                    Fantasy XIV. The Feast was an arena featuring 
                    structured four-versus-four battles where a 
                    player could register with up to three teammates 
                    to challenge another four-person team. 
                    This mode was removed in patch 6.1, 
                    when it was replaced with Crystalline 
                    Conflict,[11] which consists of two 
                    teams of five competing to seize 
                    control of and push a crystal which 
                    starts at the middle of the arena to 
                    each team's goal point. The second type, 
                    Frontlines, is a large battleground in which 
                    players form teams of up to 24 members. 
                    Teams are delineated by players' allegiance 
                    to one of three Grand Companies and the 
                    team which reaches the target number of 
                    points first wins the match. Multiple 
                    modes are available, each with differing 
                    locations and rulesets. Within the game, 
                    Frontlines is presented as an organized 
                    set of military exercises between the three 
                    nations with the ulterior goal of jockeying 
                    for dominance of regions rich in magical 
                    artifacts.[12] The third type, Rival Wings, 
                    is a battle arena mode where players 
                    manipulate minion waves and pilot mechs to 
                    destroy enemy objectives.
                </p>
                <h2 id="section-5">Battles and party system</h2>
                <p>
                    Players fight enemies using a combination of 
                    physical attacks, weapon skills, and magical attacks; 
                    these battles form the basis of party play in Final 
                    Fantasy XIV. Most battle content in the game requires 
                    parties of a specific size, including four players 
                    for dungeons and eight players for boss battles. 
                    The "Duty Finder" is an automated matching feature 
                    that sorts players into parties for selected content 
                    across different servers.[8] The "Party Finder" is a 
                    bulletin board where players may recruit players 
                    from any server on their data center for any kind 
                    of content including dungeons, raid battles, FATE 
                    parties, and more. Members of a party fill 
                    traditional MMORPG roles like tank, healer, 
                    and damage dealer.[13] Tanks draw the enemy's a
                    ttention away from other party members who 
                    generally have weaker defense, healers use 
                    restorative abilities and support the party 
                    with damage and enhancing abilities, and damage 
                    dealers focus on attacking the enemy.[14] 
                    Teamwork and strategy are required to defeat 
                    the strongest enemies. "Limit Breaks" are 
                    special abilities that can only be performed 
                    if members of the party excel at their roles.[15]

                    Free Companies are player-run guilds, 
                    organized bands of adventurers under the 
                    auspices of one of the three Grand Companies 
                    of Eorzea. Free Company members may gain 
                    access to a shared company chest, a private 
                    chat channel, and Company Actions which 
                    are 24-hour buffs to certain aspects of 
                    gameplay, such as increased EXP gain or 
                    reduced gear damage.[16] Free Company 
                    members may also pool their resources 
                    to purchase a house in one of the residential 
                    districts. In addition to decorating the house, 
                    players may use the grounds to grow unique 
                    items through the gardening system, train 
                    their chocobo companion, embark on airship 
                    expeditions, and purchase a private room 
                    for personal use. Linkshells are another 
                    form of in-game networking; whereas 
                    players may only belong in one Free Company, 
                    they may join multiple linkshells which act 
                    as private chat channels for interested 
                    sub-groups.[16]

                <p>
                    Under the Armoury System, a character's 
                    equipped weapon determines the character 
                    class and players may change their class 
                    at will by changing weapons.[17] Classes 
                    are divided into four disciplines: 
                    Disciples of War, masters of physical 
                    combat; Disciples of Magic, practitioners 
                    of the magical arts; Disciples of the 
                    Hand, crafters and handymen who synthesize 
                    and repair items; and Disciples of the 
                    Land, gatherers who collect resources 
                    from the environment. The Job System 
                    builds upon the Armoury System for 
                    Disciples of War and Magic. It allows 
                    access to powerful skills, magic, 
                    weapons, and armor exclusive to the 
                    job corresponding to that class. 
                    These jobs, many based on classic Final 
                    Fantasy character jobs, are more suited 
                    to party-based combat.[18]
