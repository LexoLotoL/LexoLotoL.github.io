            The viral Kanafeh-inspired Chocolate Bar from a dessert spot 
            called The Fix in Dubai has been going viral and since lots 
            of us are a plane ride away, we're going to make it at home 
            and even better! Oozing with pistachio butter and crispy 
            toasted shredded phyllo bits, this chocolate is the definition 
            of indulgence. Every single bite is so creamy but also so 
            crispy at the same time and the taste is so reminiscent of 
            everyone's favorite Arab dessert!
